block cellular automata are useful for simulations of physical quantities because it is straightforward to choose transition rules that obey physical constraints such as reversibility and conservation laws a block cellular automaton consists of the following components in each time step the transition rule is applied simultaneously and synchronously to all of the tiles in the partition then the partition is shifted and the same operation is repeated in the next time step and so forth in this way as with any cellular automaton the pattern of cell states changes over time to perform some nontrivial computation or simulation the simplest partitioning scheme is probably the margolus neighborhood named after norman margolus who first studied block cellular automata using this neighborhood structure in the margolus neighborhood the lattice is divided into cell blocks or squares in two dimensions or cubes in three dimensions etc which are shifted by one cell along each dimension on alternate timesteps a closely related technique due to k morita and m harao consists in partitioning each cell into a finite number of parts each part being devoted to some neighbor the evolution proceeds by exchanging the corresponding parts between neighbors and then applying on each

it is similar to a gear pump except the lobes are designed to almost meet rather than touch and turn each other an early example of a lobe pump is the roots blower patented in 1860 to blow combustion air to melt iron in blast furnaces but now more commonly used as an engine supercharger lobe pumps are used in a variety of industries including pulp and paper chemical food beverage pharmaceutical and biotechnology they are popular in these diverse industries because they offer superb sanitary qualities high efficiency reliability corrosion resistance and good clean in place and steam in place cip sip characteristics rotary pumps can handle solids e g cherries and olives slurries pastes and a variety of liquids if wetted they offer self priming performance a gentle pumping action minimizes product degradation they also offer continuous and intermittent reversible flows and can operate dry for brief periods of time flow is relatively independent of changes in process pressure too so output is relatively constant and continuous lobe pumps are similar to external gear pumps in operation in that fluid flows around the interior of the casing unlike external gear pumps however the lobes do not make contact
